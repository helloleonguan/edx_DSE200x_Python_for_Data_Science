Pandas 

1. Panda Series: 1-d labeled data & Data Frame: 2-d labeled data, columns can be of diff types.
2. import, transform, visualize 
3. import pandas as pd (index + data)
4. Series is heterpgeneous. data can be of diff types.
5. ser[] or ser.loc[] to access values or the iloc function
6. DataFrame: a stack of Series & each observation has its index & each column has its own label
7. we can convert a list of Python dict to DataFrame
8. df[<column>] to access column & df[num] to access observations
9. df.pop(<column>) pop & remove a column. del df[<column>] does the same thing but does not pop it to a var. 

Data Ingestion: import data
1. csv, jason, html, sql tables & queries and etc. can be imported into pandas.
2. to have a peek at the data file: !head -10 <text file>

Descriptive Statistics
1. sd[<column>].describe()
2. df.corr(): pairwise correlations
3. min(), max(), mode(), median(), mean(), std(), any(), all() more: count(), clip(), rank(), round() 
4. filter.any() similar for all()
