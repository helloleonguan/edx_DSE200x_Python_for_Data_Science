Jupyter Notebook & Numpy

Jupyter notebook:
1. Benefits: documented data science & reproducible science & presentation of results & support Julia, Python & R
2. To run a code cell: a) use the run button >| b) press Shift+Enter
3. _ refers to the last output
4. Press Esc to exit editing mode
5. For documenting, Jupyter notebook has Markdown Format. (e.g. Markdown Cell type) It also can be used for LateX formmatting. => For writing research findings/papers. 
6. Add explanations below the graph or above the code block. 
7. under the Kernel, there are different run options. 
8. To produce a static result doc, we can export the notebook as a HTML file. 
9. Unix commands can also be executed in Jupyter notebook by adding a '!' before each command. 
10. $ referencing a variable in UNIX command. 

Numpy:
11. Primary package for scientific computing in Python
12. features: multi-dimensional arrays, built-in array operations, broadcasting, fast (integration of other languages), many packages built upon Numpy. 
13.
