Week 1: Getting Started with Data Science

1. Data science: big data -> insight -> action
2. data + questions(analysis) => insights [repeatedly re-enforcement]
3. Actionable Information: historical data + near real-time data => Prediction
4. How much data is big data: 
    a) mostly data in TB or EB
    b) Scientific Data Magagement Organizations: HPWREN, MODIS, LIGO, Deep Space Network and etc.
5. GB => TB => PB => EB => ZB
6. Data Explosion: 0.8 ZB in 2009 => 35.2 ZB in 2020 
7. Programming Skills:
    a) Python
    b) Stats
    c) Machine Leanring
    d) Scalable Big Data Analysis

8. Features of Data Science: 
    1. Maths expertise
    2. Computing 
    3. Business Insights / Domain Knowledge
9. Traits of Data scientist:
    1. Passion for data
    2. Relate problem to analytics
    3. Care about engineering solutions
    4. Exhibit curiosity
    5. Communicate with teammates
10. Why use Python:
    1. easy to read & learn
    2. vibrant community
    3. rich libraries
    4. applicable to each step in data science process
    5. Jupyter notebook
11. Toolkit:
    1. Jupyter notebook
    2. NumPy
    3. Pandas
    4. Matplotlib
    5. Scikit-learn
    6. BeautifulSoup

## Case Study: Soccer Data Analysis
12. Goals: 
    a) form meaningful players groups
    b) discover other players that are similar to your favorite athlete
    c) Form strong teams by using analytics
13. Insights on player strengths, enhancing performance, critical attributes for a player's performance
14. Key steps in a Data Science Project
    a) Acquire
    b) Prepare
    c) Analyze
    d) Report 
    e) Act
15. Data Collection from Diverse Sources
    1. Databases
    2. Text files
    3. Live feeds
16. Data Ingestion to Analytics Platform(Python)
17. Data Preparation: Explore using Statistics
18. Data Cleaning: missing values, outliners, Nulls -> removal or interpolation
19. Data Visualization
20. Analysis & Modeling: supervised/unsupervised/semi learning 
21. Feature Selection: the most important/critical features & complex features can also be contructed
22. Interpreting Results: distributions, uniqueness
23. Presenting outcomes: how to interpret the results

Data Science Processes
24. data + a question in mind
25. acquire -> prepare -> analyze -> report -> act
26. form a data science problem & assess the situation & define objectives & criteria
27. I - acquire data: identify dataset, retrieve data, query data
1) what data is available? 
2) data sources: SQL/NoSQL databases, text files, from websites (REST API) and programming interfaces
28. prepare: explore data, pre-process data
1) preliminary investigations: correlations (dependencies), general trends (how data change over time), outliers (double check data), summary statistics (mean, median, mode, range, s.d.)
2) visualizations: they can give you a rough impression to show data distribution/how data changes over time
3) pre-processing data: clean the data (inconsistencies, duplicates, missing values, invalid data, outliers --- we can remove, merge, generate estimates bad data points - we need domain knowledge to do this) and then transform the data (scaling, transformation, feature selection, dimensionality reduction(e.g. PCA), manipulation)
 -- remember garbage in = garbage out
29. analyze: select analytical techniques & build models
1) classification: predict the category
2) regression: predict numeric values
3) clustering: organize similar items into groups
4) association analysis: find rules to capture associations between items
5) graph analytics: use graph structures to find connections between entities
-- Modelling: select technique, build model, validate model(reserved data)
Further questions: repeat analysis/take deeper dive/act on results
30. report: evaluation & present results & visualization
1) determine what to present: main results/any values/models (present all findings even if it is puzzling & inconclusive)
31. act on data: apply results into practice 
1) actionable insghts: automation & stakeholders (OR real-time actions)
2) evaluations for further experimentation
