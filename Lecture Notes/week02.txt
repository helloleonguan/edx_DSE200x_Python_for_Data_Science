Intro to Python & UNIX

1. Python: giant ecosystem of tools for connecting and working with mane sources of real-world data across a lot of domains. 
2. Variables: types: byte/bytearray
3. primitive types are also objects
4. operator <is> returns if the references point to the same object 
5. string is immutable in Python
6. range(start, stop[, step]) start inclusive & stop exclusive 
7. common string functions: lower(), upper(), +, *<times>, strip(), split(), [n:m], in, find(), 
8. string formatting: 
> s = "we love {0} {1}"
> s.format("data", "analysis")
9. common list functions: len(), append(), pop(<i>), remove(<elem>), extend(), zip()
10. list: y = x 2 refs to the same object because list is mutuable 
11. tuples are immutable
12. dictionaries (unordered): we can use a tuple as key 
13. common dict functions: get(), in, pop(), items()
14. comprehension: [<elem>/<k:v> for <i> in <list/range>]
15. common set functions: set([]), add(), discard(), remove(), union(), intersection(), |, & 


16. UNIX provides: file management, data manipulation, simple scripting. 
17. Shell is the interface between programs and kernel. Run commands. 
18. . refers to the working directory & .. refers to the parent directory. ~ refers to the home directory. 
19. common commands
ls <-l>|<-a>|<path>, cd, clear, cat, man <command>(manual pages), mkdir, *(wild card), cp|mv <from> <to>, more, sort, uniq, wc, who, ps, paste, cut 
pwd: print current working directory.
20. stdin, stdout, stderr 
21. Redirecting: 
> command < somefile -- read from
> command > afile1 -- output to 
> command 1> afile2 -- explicitly as FD1
> command 2> afile3 -- output stderr to
> command 2> afile4 > afile5 -- separate stderr & stdout
>  .... >> .... -- append 
>  .... 2>&> file -- to the same file
22. ';' is used to have multi-line commands
23. /dev/null: not storing/showing anything
24. Pipes & Filters
|: send output from previous command to next command
Filter commands: grep, more, less, sort, uniq
25. Exploratory Data Analysis in UNIX
head, tail, cur, sed, find, tr, gnuplot
