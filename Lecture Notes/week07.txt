1. learning from data on its own, perform a specific task to discover hidden pattern. 
2. amount of data and quality are the keys
3. e.g. digital fraud detection, hand-written digit recognition, recommendation on websites, predictive analytics
4. Data mining: in database or warehouse

5. Classification: predicting category
6. Regression: predicting numeric value
7. Clustering: organize similar items into groups 
8. Association: find rules to capture associations between items

9. Supervised Approaches: having labeled data. e.g. classification & regression
10. Unsupervised Approaches: target is unknown, unlabeled data. e.g. clustering & association

Terminology
11. data types: numeric, categorical, strings

12. scikit-learn: extensive set of tools, nice doc.
