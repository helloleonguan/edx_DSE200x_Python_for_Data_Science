    "\n",
    "<p>The following research questions are decided to be the center of this analysis:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>1. What are the top 2~3 features (from this titanic dataset) to most likely determine the survival outcome? </li>\n",
    "    <li>2. Can we have a decent prediction accuracy (above 0.8) of the survival outcome based on most of the features provided in this titanic dataset? <b>[Normal Classification]</b></li>\n",
    "    <li>3. Can we predict the probability of survival for each passenger based on most of the features provided in this titanic dataset? <b>[Bayes Classification]</b> </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Motivation:</b></p>\n",
    "<p>An analysis of such could be extremely beneficial for various parties. Firstly, finding the most predictive features and predicting the probability of survival would allow insurance company to introduce different classes of insurance for different types passengers more suitably. Besides, it would be nice to give those metrics (survival probability in a catastrophic event, key survival features and etc) to the passengers before purchasing the tickets so that they have an idea of the potential risks when encountering an accident. Furthermore, a successful investigation of this dataset might also be useful for predicting survival rates for other events like earthquakes or tornadoes with, of course, extre domain knowledge amd further modifications. At last, I myself am interested in those problems as well because my initial intuition (before any research) tells me that those features provided in the dataset would not be good indicators of survival. It is both exciting and intriguing to see that how my intuition fails me and learn some new insights into those tragic events. </p>"
